(2015) Acute Effects of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide in Healthy Subjects. Biological psychiatry, 8, 544-53.","BACKGROUND: After no research in humans for >40 years, there is renewed interest 
in using lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in clinical psychiatric research and
practice. There are no modern studies on the subjective and autonomic effects of 
LSD, and its endocrine effects are unknown. In animals, LSD disrupts prepulse
inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, and patients with
schizophrenia exhibit similar impairments in PPI. However, no data are available 
on the effects of LSD on PPI in humans.
METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, LSD 
(200 Î¼g) and placebo were administered to 16 healthy subjects (8 women, 8 men).
Outcome measures included psychometric scales; investigator ratings; PPI of the
acoustic startle response; and autonomic, endocrine, and adverse effects.
RESULTS: Administration of LSD to healthy subjects produced pronounced
alterations in waking consciousness that lasted 12 hours. The predominant effects
induced by LSD included visual hallucinations, audiovisual synesthesia, and
positively experienced derealization and depersonalization phenomena. Subjective 
well-being, happiness, closeness to others, openness, and trust were increased by
LSD. Compared with placebo, LSD decreased PPI. LSD significantly increased blood 
pressure, heart rate, body temperature, pupil size, plasma cortisol, prolactin,
oxytocin, and epinephrine. Adverse effects produced by LSD completely subsided
within 72 hours. No severe acute adverse effects were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to marked hallucinogenic effects, LSD exerts
methylenedioxymethamphetamine-like empathogenic mood effects that may be useful
in psychotherapy. LSD altered sensorimotor gating in a human model of psychosis, 
supporting the use of LSD in translational psychiatric research. In a controlled 
clinical setting, LSD can be used safely, but it produces significant

hallucinogen or psychedelic that modulates consciousness in a marked and novel
way. This study sought to examine the acute and mid-term psychological effects of
LSD in a controlled study.
METHOD: A total of 20 healthy volunteers participated in this within-subjects
study. Participants received LSD (75 Âµg, intravenously) on one occasion and
placebo (saline, intravenously) on another, in a balanced order, with at least 2 
weeks separating sessions. Acute subjective effects were measured using the
Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire and the Psychotomimetic States
Inventory (PSI). A measure of optimism (the Revised Life Orientation Test), the
Revised NEO Personality Inventory, and the Peter's Delusions Inventory were
issued at baseline and 2 weeks after each session.
RESULTS: LSD produced robust psychological effects; including heightened mood but
also high scores on the PSI, an index of psychosis-like symptoms. Increased
optimism and trait openness were observed 2 weeks after LSD (and not placebo) and
there were no changes in delusional thinking.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings reinforce the view that psychedelics elicit
psychosis-like symptoms acutely yet improve psychological wellbeing in the mid to
long term. It is proposed that acute alterations in mood are secondary to a more 
fundamental modulation in the quality of cognition, and that increased cognitive 
flexibility subsequent to serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) stimulation promotes
emotional lability during intoxication and leaves a residue of 'loosened
cognition' in the mid to long term that is conducive to improved psychological
wellbeing.",NULL,75,µg,"The study physician inserted a cannula into a vein in the antecubital fossa in preparation for intravenous (i.v.) dosing and the volunteer was encouraged to relax prior to drug/placebo administration.

effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern
neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin
labeling (ASL), blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) measures, and
magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state conditions,
revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with
its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood 
flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded primary
visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with
ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts
greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining
its hallucinatory quality. LSD's marked effects on the visual cortex did not
significantly correlate with the drug's other characteristic effects on
consciousness, however. Rather, decreased connectivity between the
parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings
of ""ego-dissolution"" and ""altered meaning,"" implying the importance of this
particular circuit for the maintenance of ""self"" or ""ego"" and its processing of
""meaning."" Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging
metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional
significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents
an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of
growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 18, 5119-24.","Social ties are crucial for physical and mental health. However, psychiatric
patients frequently encounter social rejection. Moreover, an increased reactivity
to social exclusion influences the development, progression, and treatment of
various psychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the neuromodulatory substrates of
rejection experiences are largely unknown. The preferential serotonin (5-HT)
2A/1A receptor agonist, psilocybin (Psi), reduces the processing of negative
stimuli, but whether 5-HT2A/1A receptor stimulation modulates the processing of
negative social interactions remains unclear. Therefore, this double-blind,
randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over study assessed the neural response to
social exclusion after the acute administration of Psi (0.215 mg/kg) or placebo
(Pla) in 21 healthy volunteers by using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) and resting-state magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Participants
reported a reduced feeling of social exclusion after Psi vs. Pla administration, 
and the neural response to social exclusion was decreased in the dorsal anterior 
cingulate cortex (dACC) and the middle frontal gyrus, key regions for social pain
processing. The reduced neural response in the dACC was significantly correlated 
with Psi-induced changes in self-processing and decreased aspartate (Asp)
content. In conclusion, 5-HT2A/1A receptor stimulation with psilocybin seems to
reduce social pain processing in association with changes in self-experience.
These findings may be relevant to the normalization of negative social
interaction processing in psychiatric disorders characterized by increased
rejection sensitivity. The current results also emphasize the importance of
5-HT2A/1A receptor subtypes and the Asp system in the control of social
functioning, and as prospective targets in the treatment of sociocognitive

METHODS: We conducted two placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over studies
using oral administration of 100 and 200Â Î¼g LSD in 24 and 16 subjects,

Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) scale after both doses and the Mystical 
Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) after 200Â Î¼g.
RESULTS: On the MEQ, 200Â Î¼g LSD induced mystical experiences that were comparable
to those in patients who underwent LSD-assisted psychotherapy but were fewer than
those reported for psilocybin in healthy subjects or patients. On the 5D-ASC
scale, LSD produced higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed

consequences and influence the development and treatment of several psychiatric
disorders. Furthermore, empathy has been shown to play a crucial role in moral
and prosocial behavior. Although the serotonin system has been implicated in
modulating empathy and moral behavior, the relative contribution of the various
serotonin receptor subtypes is still unknown.
Methods: We investigated the acute effect of psilocybin (0.215 mg/kg p.o.) in
healthy human subjects on different facets of empathy and hypothetical moral
decision-making using the multifaceted empathy test (n=32) and the moral dilemma 
task (n=24).
Results: Psilocybin significantly increased emotional, but not cognitive empathy 
compared with placebo, and the increase in implicit emotional empathy was
significantly associated with psilocybin-induced changed meaning of percepts. In 
contrast, moral decision-making remained unaffected by psilocybin.
Conclusions: These findings provide first evidence that psilocybin has distinct
effects on social cognition by enhancing emotional empathy but not moral
behavior. Furthermore, together with previous findings, psilocybin appears to
promote emotional empathy presumably via activation of serotonin 2A/1A receptors,
suggesting that targeting serotonin 2A/1A receptors has implications for
potential treatment of dysfunctional social cognition.",NULL,215,"mg/kg body weight","""Each participant received psilocybin on one session (0.215 mg/

3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) in vitro and in 16 healthy
subjects. The clinical study used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
four-session, crossover design. In vitro, duloxetine blocked the release of both 
5-HT and NE by MDMA or by its metabolite 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine from
transmitter-loaded human cells expressing the 5-HT or NE transporter. In humans, 
duloxetine inhibited the effects of MDMA including elevations in circulating NE, 
increases in blood pressure and heart rate, and the subjective drug effects.
Duloxetine inhibited the pharmacodynamic response to MDMA despite an increase in 
duloxetine-associated elevations in plasma MDMA levels. The findings confirm the 
important role of MDMA-induced 5-HT and NE release in the psychotropic effects of
MDMA. Duloxetine may be useful in the treatment of psychostimulant

Biological psychiatry, 11, 898-906.","BACKGROUND: Serotonin (5-HT) 1A and 2A receptors have been associated with
dysfunctional emotional processing biases in mood disorders. These receptors
further predominantly mediate the subjective and behavioral effects of psilocybin
and might be important for its recently suggested antidepressive effects.
However, the effect of psilocybin on emotional processing biases and the specific
contribution of 5-HT2A receptors across different emotional domains is unknown.
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind study, 17 healthy human subjects received 
on 4 separate days placebo, psilocybin (215 Î¼g/kg), the preferential 5-HT2A
antagonist ketanserin (50 mg), or psilocybin plus ketanserin. Mood states were
assessed by self-report ratings, and behavioral and event-related potential
measurements were used to quantify facial emotional recognition and goal-directed
behavior toward emotional cues.
RESULTS: Psilocybin enhanced positive mood and attenuated recognition of negative
facial expression. Furthermore, psilocybin increased goal-directed behavior
toward positive compared with negative cues, facilitated positive but inhibited
negative sequential emotional effects, and valence-dependently attenuated the
P300 component. Ketanserin alone had no effects but blocked the
psilocybin-induced mood enhancement and decreased recognition of negative facial 
expression.

various psychological domains and that activation of 5-HT2A receptors is central

OBJECTIVES: This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) and signal detection 
theory to compare the effects of the NMDA (via S-ketamine) and 5-HT (via
psilocybin) receptor system on non-conscious or conscious emotional face
processing biases.
METHODS: S-ketamine or psilocybin was administrated to two groups of healthy
subjects in a double-blind within-subject placebo-controlled design. We
behaviorally assessed objective thresholds for non-conscious discrimination in
all drug conditions. Electrophysiological responses to fearful, happy, and
neutral faces were subsequently recorded with the face-specific P100 and N170

RESULTS: Both S-ketamine and psilocybin impaired the encoding of fearful faces as
expressed by a reduced N170 over parieto-occipital brain regions. In contrast,
while S-ketamine also impaired the encoding of happy facial expressions,
psilocybin had no effect on the N170 in response to happy faces.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the NMDA and 5-HT receptor systems
differentially contribute to the structural encoding of emotional face
