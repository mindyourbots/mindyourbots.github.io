preponderance. To date, there are no systematic data on gender differences in the
subjective effects of MDMA.
OBJECTIVES: The present work analyzed the pooled data from three controlled
studies on the psychological and physiological effects of MDMA in healthy
volunteers with no or minimal MDMA experience. A particular focus of the analyses
were possible gender differences.
METHODS: A total of 74 subjects (54 male, 20 female) participated in all three
studies. MDMA in oral doses ranging from 70-150 mg (1.35-1.8 mg/kg) was
administered under double-blind placebo-controlled conditions. Subjective peak
changes were assessed by standardized psychometric rating scales. Physiological
measures were blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral body temperature.

RESULTS: Psychoactive effects of MDMA were more intense in women than in men.
Women especially had higher scores for MDMA-induced perceptual changes, thought
disturbances, and fear of loss of body control. The dose of MDMA positively
correlated with the intensity of perceptual changes in women. Acute adverse
effects and sequelae were also more frequent in female than in male subjects. In 
contrast, men showed higher increases in blood pressure than woman.
CONCLUSIONS: The fact that equal doses of MDMA per kilogram body weight produce

(2001) Localization of MDMA-induced brain activity in healthy volunteers using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Human brain mapping, 3, 152-65.","3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'Ecstasy') is a psychostimulant drug
producing heightened mood and facilitated social communication. In animal
studies, MDMA effects are primarily mediated by serotonin (5-HT), but also by
dopamine (DA) and possibly noradrenaline (NA). In humans, however, the
neurochemical and neurophysiological basis of acute MDMA effects remains unknown.
The distribution of active neuronal populations after administration of a single 
dose of MDMA (1.7 mg/kg) or placebo was studied in 16 healthy, MDMA-naÃ¯ve
volunteers. Thirty-one-channel scalp EEGs during resting with open and closed
eyes was analyzed in the different EEG frequency bands. Scalp maps of power
showed significant, global differences between MDMA and placebo in both eye
conditions and all frequency bands. Low resolution brain electromagnetic
tomography (LORETA) was used to compute 3D, functional images of electric
neuronal activity from the scalp EEG data. MDMA produced a widespread decrease of
slow and medium frequency activity and an increase of fast frequency activity in 
the anterior temporal and posterior orbital cortex, concomitant with a marked
enhancement of mood, emotional arousal and increased extraversion. This
activation of frontotemporal areas indicates that the observed enhancement of
mood and possibly the increased extroversion rely on modulation of limbic
orbitofrontal and anterotemporal structures known to be involved in emotional
processes. Comparison of the MDMA-specific EEG pattern with that of various 5-HT,

preattentive auditory event-related potential (ERP)-depends on NMDA receptor
(NMDAR) functioning. To explore if the strength of MMN generation reflects the
functional condition of the NMDAR system in healthy volunteers, we analyzed
correlations between MMN recorded before drug administration and subsequent
responses to the NMDAR antagonist ketamine or the 5-HT2a agonist psilocybin.
METHODS: In two separate studies, MMN was recorded to both frequency and duration
deviants prior to administration of ketamine or psilocybin. Behavioral and
subjective effects of ketamine and psilocybin were assessed with the Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale and the OAV Scale-a rating scale developed to measure
altered states of consciousness. Correlations between ERP amplitudes (MMN, N1,
and P2) and drug-induced effects were calculated in each study group and compared
between them.
RESULTS: Smaller MMN to both pitch and duration deviants was significantly
correlated to stronger effects during ketamine, but not psilocybin
administration. No significant correlations were observed for N1 and P2.

(2005) NMDA hypofunction in the posterior cingulate as a model for schizophrenia: an exploratory ketamine administration study in fMRI. Schizophrenia research, 2-3, 235-48.","BACKGROUND: Based on animal data, NMDA receptor hypofunction has been suggested
as a model for positive symptoms in schizophrenia. NMDA receptor hypofunction
affects several corticolimbic brain regions, of which the posterior cingulate
seems to be the most sensitive. However, empirical support for a crucial role of 
posterior cingulate NMDA hypofunction in the pathophysiology of positive symptoms
is still missing in humans. We therefore conducted an fMRI study using the NMDA
antagonist ketamine in healthy human subjects during episodic memory retrieval,
which is supposed to activate the posterior cingulate.
METHODS: We investigated 16 healthy subjects which were assigned to either
placebo (n = 7; saline) or ketamine (n = 9; 0.6 mg/kg/h) group in a double-blind 
study design. All subjects received their infusion while performing an episodic
memory retrieval task in the scanner. Immediately after the fMRI session,
psychopathological effects of ketamine were measured using the Altered States of 
Consciousness Questionnaire.
RESULTS: The placebo group showed BOLD signal increases in the posterior and
anterior cingulate during retrieval. Signal increases were significantly lower in
the ketamine group. Lower signal increases in the posterior cingulate correlated 
significantly with positive (i.e. psychosis-like) symptoms induced by ketamine.
CONCLUSION: The present study for the first time demonstrates a relationship
between NMDA receptors, posterior cingulate and positive (i.e. psychosis-like)
symptoms in humans. Confirming findings from animal studies, it supports the
hypothesis of a pathophysiological role of NMDA receptor hypofunction in the
posterior cingulate in schizophrenia.",NULL,0.6,mg/kg/h,"Infusion over 90 mins; Task began after 20 mins; ""The ketamine group received a ketamine infusion (0.6 mg/kg/h) during anatomical and functional image acquisition (90 min).""; ""The placebo group received saline (0.9% NaCl) over the same period of time.""",Ketamine,i.v.,7.22,28.10,27.87,68.03,25.92,64.72,42.92,61.31,16.55,57.90

ketamine dosage was increased (55.1% decrease, placebo versus 0.15 mg x kg(-1) x

dosage but to a lesser extent (23.1% decrease). During placebo administration, a 
typical pain activation network (thalamus, insula, cingulate, and prefrontal
cortex) was found, whereas decreased pain perception with ketamine was associated
with a dose-dependent reduction of pain-induced cerebral activations. Analysis of
the dose-dependent ketamine effects on pain processing showed a decreasing
activation of the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), insula and anterior

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the neural correlates
underlying orienting of attention in the human N-methyl-D-aspartic acid

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen healthy volunteers participated in a randomized, 
double-blind, cross-over event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging

covert orienting of attention task with nonpredictive peripheral cues, and we

RESULTS: DMT, but not S-ketamine, slowed down reaction times significantly. IOR
was blunted after DMT, but not after S-ketamine. Relative to placebo, S-ketamine 
increased activation in the IOR condition in the right superior frontal gyrus,
left superior temporal gyrus, and right midfrontal frontal gyrus.

outcome indicates that pharmacological fMRI might be a sensitive tool to detect

We found that MDA increased self-report measures of mystical-type experience and 
other hallucinogen-like effects, including reported visual alterations. MDA
produced a significant increase in closed-eye visions (CEVs), with considerable
individual variation. Magnitude of CEVs after MDA was associated with lower
performance on measures of contour integration and object recognition.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Drug-induced visions may have greater intensity in
people with poor sensory or perceptual processing, suggesting common mechanisms
with other hallucinatory syndromes. MDA is a potential tool to investigate
mystical experiences and visual perception.

(2015) Acute Effects of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide in Healthy Subjects. Biological psychiatry, 8, 544-53.","BACKGROUND: After no research in humans for >40 years, there is renewed interest 
in using lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in clinical psychiatric research and
practice. There are no modern studies on the subjective and autonomic effects of 
LSD, and its endocrine effects are unknown. In animals, LSD disrupts prepulse
inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, and patients with
schizophrenia exhibit similar impairments in PPI. However, no data are available 
on the effects of LSD on PPI in humans.
METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, LSD 
(200 Î¼g) and placebo were administered to 16 healthy subjects (8 women, 8 men).
Outcome measures included psychometric scales; investigator ratings; PPI of the
acoustic startle response; and autonomic, endocrine, and adverse effects.
RESULTS: Administration of LSD to healthy subjects produced pronounced
alterations in waking consciousness that lasted 12 hours. The predominant effects
induced by LSD included visual hallucinations, audiovisual synesthesia, and
positively experienced derealization and depersonalization phenomena. Subjective 
well-being, happiness, closeness to others, openness, and trust were increased by
LSD. Compared with placebo, LSD decreased PPI. LSD significantly increased blood 
pressure, heart rate, body temperature, pupil size, plasma cortisol, prolactin,
oxytocin, and epinephrine. Adverse effects produced by LSD completely subsided
within 72 hours. No severe acute adverse effects were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to marked hallucinogenic effects, LSD exerts
methylenedioxymethamphetamine-like empathogenic mood effects that may be useful
in psychotherapy. LSD altered sensorimotor gating in a human model of psychosis, 
supporting the use of LSD in translational psychiatric research. In a controlled 
clinical setting, LSD can be used safely, but it produces significant

The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology, 9, .","BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia has been associated with disturbances of thalamic
functioning. In light of recent evidence suggesting a significant impact of the
glutamatergic system on key symptoms of schizophrenia, we assessed whether
modulation of the glutamatergic system via blockage of the N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA)-receptor might lead to changes of thalamic functional connectivity.
METHODS: Based on the ketamine model of psychosis, we investigated changes in
cortico-thalamic functional connectivity by intravenous ketamine challenge during
a 55-minute resting-state scan. Thirty healthy volunteers were measured with
pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging using a double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design.
RESULTS: Functional connectivity analysis revealed significant ketamine-specific 
changes within the thalamus hub network, more precisely, an increase of
cortico-thalamic connectivity of the somatosensory and temporal cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that changes of thalamic functioning as
described for schizophrenia can be partly mimicked by NMDA-receptor blockage.
This adds substantial knowledge about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying
the profound changes of perception and behavior during the application of
NMDA-receptor antagonists.",NULL,0.12,"mg/kg body weight","The ketamine dosage was applied using a 1-minute bolus of 0.11 mg/kg body weight followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.12 mg/kg for 19 minutes.","Ketamine (S-Ketamine)",i.v.,21.72,18.80,40.00,34.83,84.26,57.90,40.33,25.15,44.90,33.90

(2016) Effects of ketamine on cognition-emotion interaction in the brain. NeuroImage, Pt A, 8-15.","Cognition-emotion interaction in the brain can be investigated by incorporating
stimuli with emotional content into cognitive tasks. Emotional stimuli in the
context of a working memory (WM) task yield increased activation in WM-related
lateral prefrontal regions, whereas cognitive effort enhances deactivation in
emotion-related cortical midline regions. N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate
receptors (NMDA-Rs) are critically involved in WM, and NMDA-R antagonists, such
as ketamine, accordingly affect WM but also have a profound impact on emotional
processing, as underscored by the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms after
administration of a single dose of ketamine. The effect of ketamine on both
cognitive and emotional processing therefore makes it a useful tool to further
explore cognition-emotion interaction in the brain. Twenty-three healthy subjects
were administered ketamine to investigate whether its effects on WM performance
and brain reactivity depend on emotional content or emotional valence of stimuli.
Furthermore, we aimed at investigating how ketamine affects the integration of
emotion and WM processes in emotion-related cortical midline regions and
WM-related lateral prefrontal regions. Results show that ketamine modulates
cognition-emotion interaction in the brain by inducing lateralized and
valence-specific effects in emotion-related cortical midline regions, WM-related 
lateral prefrontal regions and insula. In emotion-related cortical midline
regions ketamine abolishes enhancement of deactivation normally observed during
cognitive effort, while in the right DLPFC and the left insula the previously
described pattern of increased activation due to emotional content is abrogated
exclusively for negative stimuli. Our data therefore shows a specific effect of
ketamine on cognition-emotion interaction in the brain and indicates that its
effect on amelioration of negative biases in MDD patients might be related to
less interference of cognitive processing by negative emotional content.",NULL,0.25,"mg/kg body weight/h","Ketamine was administered as an intravenous bolus of 0.12 mg/kg approximately 25 min prior to the fMRI task, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h during the entire scanning and task period.","Ketamine (S-Ketamine)",i.v.,14.22,0.80,18.69,1.17,39.65,1.39,37.67,1.19,29.56,1.36

clinical research. Acute mystical-type experiences that are acutely induced by
hallucinogens are thought to contribute to their potential therapeutic effects.
However, no data have been reported on LSD-induced mystical experiences and their
relationship to alterations of consciousness. Additionally, LSD dose- and
concentration-response functions with regard to alterations of consciousness are 
lacking.
METHODS: We conducted two placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over studies
using oral administration of 100 and 200Â Î¼g LSD in 24 and 16 subjects,
respectively. Acute effects of LSD were assessed using the 5 Dimensions of
Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) scale after both doses and the Mystical 
Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) after 200Â Î¼g.
RESULTS: On the MEQ, 200Â Î¼g LSD induced mystical experiences that were comparable
to those in patients who underwent LSD-assisted psychotherapy but were fewer than
those reported for psilocybin in healthy subjects or patients. On the 5D-ASC
scale, LSD produced higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed
meaning of percepts after 200Â Î¼g compared with 100Â Î¼g. Plasma levels of LSD were 
not positively correlated with its effects, with the exception of ego dissolution
at 100Â Î¼g.
CONCLUSIONS: Mystical-type experiences were infrequent after LSD, possibly
because of the set and setting used in the present study. LSD may produce greater
or different alterations of consciousness at 200Â Î¼g (i.e., a dose that is
currently used in psychotherapy in Switzerland) compared with 100Â Î¼g (i.e., a
dose used in imaging studies). Ego dissolution may reflect plasma levels of LSD,

lacking.
METHODS: We conducted two placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over studies
using oral administration of 100 and 200Â Î¼g LSD in 24 and 16 subjects,
respectively. Acute effects of LSD were assessed using the 5 Dimensions of
Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) scale after both doses and the Mystical 
Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) after 200Â Î¼g.
RESULTS: On the MEQ, 200Â Î¼g LSD induced mystical experiences that were comparable
to those in patients who underwent LSD-assisted psychotherapy but were fewer than
those reported for psilocybin in healthy subjects or patients. On the 5D-ASC
scale, LSD produced higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed
meaning of percepts after 200Â Î¼g compared with 100Â Î¼g. Plasma levels of LSD were 
not positively correlated with its effects, with the exception of ego dissolution

(2017) Glutamatergic deficit and schizophrenia-like negative symptoms: new evidence from ketamine-induced mismatch negativity alterations in healthy male humans. Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN, 4, 273-283.","BACKGROUND: Targeting the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a major
translational approach for treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Ketamine 
comprehensively produces schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as positive, cognitive
and negative symptoms in healthy volunteers. The amplitude of the mismatch
negativity (MMN) is known to be significantly reduced not only in patients with
schizophrenia, but also in healthy controls receiving ketamine. Accordingly, it
was the aim of the present study to investigate whether changes of MMN amplitudes
during ketamine administration are associated with the emergence of
schizophrenia-like negative symptoms in healthy volunteers.
METHODS: We examined the impact of ketamine during an MMN paradigm with
64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and assessed the psychopathological
status using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in healthy male
volunteers using a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design.
Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was used for source localization.
RESULTS: Twenty-four men were included in our analysis. Significant reductions of
MMN amplitudes and an increase in all PANSS scores were identified under the
ketamine condition. Smaller MMN amplitudes were specifically associated with more
pronounced negative symptoms. Source analysis of MMN generators indicated a
significantly reduced current source density (CSD) under the ketamine condition
in the primary auditory cortex, the posterior cingulate and the middle frontal
gyrus.
LIMITATIONS: The sample included only men within a tight age range of 20-32
years.
CONCLUSION: The MMN might represent a biomarker for negative symptoms in
schizophrenia related to an insufficient NMDAR system and could be used to
identify patients with schizophrenia with negative symptoms due to NMDAR

Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica, 6, 648-657.","OBJECTIVE: It has been proposed that the thalamocortical system is an important
site of action of hallucinogenic drugs and an essential component of the neural
correlates of consciousness. Hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD can be used to
induce profoundly altered states of consciousness, and it is thus of interest to 
test the effects of these drugs on this system.
METHOD: 100 Î¼g LSD was administrated orally to 20 healthy participants prior to
fMRI assessment. Whole brain thalamic functional connectivity was measured using 
ROI-to-ROI and ROI-to-voxel approaches. Correlation analyses were used to explore
relationships between thalamic connectivity to regions involved in auditory and
visual hallucinations and subjective ratings on auditory and visual drug effects.
RESULTS: LSD caused significant alterations in all dimensions of the 5D-ASC scale
and significantly increased thalamic functional connectivity to various cortical 
regions. Furthermore, LSD-induced functional connectivity measures between the
thalamus and the right fusiform gyrus and insula correlated significantly with
subjective auditory and visual drug effects.
CONCLUSION: Hallucinogenic drug effects might be provoked by facilitations of
cortical excitability via thalamocortical interactions. Our findings have
implications for the understanding of the mechanism of action of hallucinogenic
drugs and provide further insight into the role of the 5-HT2A -receptor in

(2011) Ketamine effects on brain function--simultaneous fMRI/EEG during a visual oddball task. NeuroImage, 2, 508-25.","BACKGROUND: Behavioral and electrophysiological human ketamine models of
schizophrenia are used for testing compounds that target the glutamatergic
system. However, corresponding functional neuroimaging models are difficult to
reconcile with functional imaging and electrophysiological findings in
schizophrenia. Resolving the discrepancies between different observational levels
is critical to understand the complex pharmacological ketamine action and its
usefulness for modeling schizophrenia pathophysiology.
METHODS: We conducted a within-subject, randomized, placebo-controlled
pharmacoimaging study in twenty-four male volunteers. Subjects were given
low-dose S-ketamine (bolus prior to functional imaging: 0.1mg/kg during 5min,
thereafter continuous infusion: 0.015625mg/kg/min reduced by 10% every ten
minutes) or placebo while performing a visual oddball task during simultaneous
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with continuous recording of
event-related potentials (P300) and electrodermal activity (EDA). Before and
after intervention, psychopathological status was assessed using the Positive and
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC)
Rating Scale.
RESULTS: P300 amplitude and corresponding BOLD responses were diminished in the
ketamine condition in cortical regions being involved in sensory
processing/selective attention. In both measurement modalities separation of drug
conditions was achieved with area under the curve (AUC) values of up to 0.8-0.9. 
Ketamine effects were also observed in the clinical, behavioral and peripheral
physiological domains (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, reaction hit and
false alarm rate, electrodermal activity and heart rate) which were in part
related to the P300/fMRI measures.
CONCLUSION: The findings from our ketamine experiment are consistent across
modalities and directly related to observations in schizophrenia supporting the
validity of the model. Our investigation provides the first prototypic example of
a pharmacoimaging study using simultaneously acquired fMRI/EEG.",NULL,0.115625,"mg/kg + mg/kg/min","S-ketamine was administered as a bolus (0.1 mg/kg during 5 min) immediately before measurements in the MRI scanner.

Psychopharmacology, 1, 227-39.","RATIONALE: Both glutamate and serotonin (5-HT) play a key role in the
pathophysiology of emotional biases. Recent studies indicate that the glutamate
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine and the 5-HT receptor
agonist psilocybin are implicated in emotion processing. However, as yet, no
study has systematically compared their contribution to emotional biases.
OBJECTIVES: This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) and signal detection 
theory to compare the effects of the NMDA (via S-ketamine) and 5-HT (via
psilocybin) receptor system on non-conscious or conscious emotional face
processing biases.
METHODS: S-ketamine or psilocybin was administrated to two groups of healthy
subjects in a double-blind within-subject placebo-controlled design. We
behaviorally assessed objective thresholds for non-conscious discrimination in
all drug conditions. Electrophysiological responses to fearful, happy, and
neutral faces were subsequently recorded with the face-specific P100 and N170
ERP.
RESULTS: Both S-ketamine and psilocybin impaired the encoding of fearful faces as
expressed by a reduced N170 over parieto-occipital brain regions. In contrast,
while S-ketamine also impaired the encoding of happy facial expressions,
psilocybin had no effect on the N170 in response to happy faces.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the NMDA and 5-HT receptor systems
differentially contribute to the structural encoding of emotional face
expressions as expressed by the N170. These findings suggest that the assessment 
of early visual evoked responses might allow detecting pharmacologically induced 
changes in emotional processing biases and thus provides a framework to study the
pathophysiology of dysfunctional emotional biases.",NULL,10.006,"mg/5min + mg/kg/min
