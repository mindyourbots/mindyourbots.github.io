describe the subjective effects of graded doses of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 
an endogenous hallucinogen and drug of abuse, in a group of experienced
hallucinogen users. We also present preliminary data from a new rating scale for 
these effects.
METHODS: Twelve highly motivated volunteers received two doses (0.04 and 0.4
mg/kg) of intravenous (IV) dimethyltryptamine fumarate ""nonblind,"" before
entering a double-blind, saline placebo-controlled, randomized study using four
doses of IV DMT. Subjects were carefully interviewed after resolution of drug
effects, providing thorough and systematic descriptions of DMT's effects. They
also were administered a new instrument, the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS). The
HRS was drafted from interviews obtained from an independent sample of 19
experienced DMT users, and modified during early stages of the study.
RESULTS: Psychological effects of IV DMT began almost immediately after
administration, peaked at 90 to 120 seconds, and were almost completely resolved 
by 30 minutes. This time course paralleled DMT blood levels previously described.
Hallucinogenic effects were seen after 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg of dimethyltryptamine
fumarate, and included a rapidly moving, brightly colored visual display of
images. Auditory effects were less common. ""Loss of control,"" associated with a
brief, but overwhelming ""rush,"" led to a dissociated state, where euphoria
alternated or coexisted with anxiety. These effects completely replaced subjects'
previously ongoing mental experience and were more vivid and compelling than
dreams or waking awareness. Lower doses, 0.1 and 0.05 mg/kg, were primarily
affective and somaesthetic, while 0.1 mg/kg elicited the least desirable effects.

""psychedelic"" effects in patients emerging from anesthesia. This study quantified
these effects of ketamine and related them to steady-state plasma concentrations.
METHODS: Ketamine or saline was administered in a single-blinded crossover
protocol to 10 psychiatrically healthy volunteers using computer-assisted
continuous infusion. A stepwise series of target plasma concentrations, 0, 50,
100, 150, and 200 ng/ml were maintained for 30 min each. After 20 min at each
step, the volunteers completed a visual analog (VAS) rating of 13 symptom scales.
Peripheral venous plasma ketamine concentrations were determined after 28 min at 
each step. One hour after discontinuation of the infusion, a psychological
inventory, the hallucinogen rating scale, was completed.
RESULTS: The relation of mean ketamine plasma concentrations to the target
concentrations was highly linear, with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.997 (P 
= 0.0027). Ketamine produced dose-related psychedelic effects. The relation
between steady-state ketamine plasma concentration and VAS scores was highly
linear for all VAS items, with linear regression coefficients ranging from R =
0.93 to 0.99 (P < 0.024 to P < 0.0005). Hallucinogen rating scale scores were

volunteers with prior experience in the use of this tea, in a single-blind
crossover placebo-controlled clinical trial.
RESULTS: Ayahuasca produced significant dose-dependent increases in five of the
six subscales of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale, in the LSD, MBG, and A scales of 
the Addiction Research Center Inventory, and in the ""liking"", ""good effects"" and 
""high"" visual analogue scales. Psychological effects were first noted after 30-60
min, peaked between 60-120 min, and were resolved by 240 min. The tea was well
tolerated from a cardiovascular point of view, with a trend toward increase for
systolic blood pressure. Modified physical sensations and nausea were the most
frequently reported somatic-dysphoric effects. The overall experience was
regarded as pleasant and satisfactory by five of the six volunteers, while one
volunteer experienced an intensely dysphoric reaction with transient
disorientation and anxiety at the medium dose and voluntarily withdrew from the
study.

affective, cognitive, and somatic spheres, with a combination of stimulatory and 
visual psychoactive effects of longer duration and milder intensity than those
previously reported for intravenously administered DMT.",NULL,1,"mg * body weight (kg)","The following experimental doses were chosen for the present study: 0.5 mg DMT/kg body weight as the low dose and 0.75 and 1.0 mg DMT/kg body weight as the medium and high dose, respectively.

Amazonian shamanism, and in the religious ceremonies of Brazilian-based syncretic
religious groups with followers in the US and several European countries. This

report we described a profile of stimulant and psychedelic effects for ayahuasca 
as measured by subjective report self-assessment instruments. In the present
study the cerebral bioavailability and time-course of effects of ayahuasca were
assessed in humans by means of topographic quantitative-electroencephalography
(q-EEG), a noninvasive method measuring drug-induced variations in brain
electrical activity.
METHODS: Two doses (one low and one high) of encapsulated freeze-dried ayahuasca,
equivalent to 0.6 and 0.85 mg DMT kg(-1) body weight, were administered to 18
healthy volunteers with previous experience in psychedelic drug use in a
double-blind crossover placebo-controlled clinical trial. Nineteen-lead
recordings were undertaken from baseline to 8 h after administration. Subjective 
effects were measured by means of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS).
RESULTS: Ayahuasca induced a pattern of psychoactive effects which resulted in
significant dose-dependent increases in all subscales of the HRS, and in
significant and dose-dependent modifications of brain electrical activity.
Absolute power decreased in all frequency bands, most prominently in the theta
band. Mean absolute power decreases (95% CI) at a representative lead (P3) 90 min
after the high dose were -20.20+/-15.23 microV2 and -2.70+/-2.21 microV2 for
total power and theta power, respectively. Relative power decreased in the delta 
(-1.20+/-1.31% after 120 min at P3) and theta (-3.30+/-2.59% after 120 min at P3)

activity and its deviation. EEG modifications began as early as 15-30 min,
reached a peak between 45 and 120 min and decreased thereafter to return to

human research with psychedelics and entactogens has explored the possibility
that drugs displaying agonist activity at the 5-HT(2A/2C) sites temporally
disrupt inhibitory neural mechanisms thought to intervene in the normal filtering
of information. Suppression of the P50 auditory evoked potential (AEP) and
prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI) are considered operational measures of
sensory (P50 suppression) and sensorimotor (PPI) gating. Contrary to findings in 
lower animals, unexpected increases in sensorimotor gating have been found in
humans following the administration of the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of the acute administration of ayahuasca on P50

ms, 240 ms and 2000 ms prepulse-to-pulse intervals) recordings were undertaken at
1.5 h and 2 h after drug intake, respectively.
RESULTS: Ayahuasca produced diverging effects on each of the two gating measures 
evaluated. Whereas significant dose-dependent reductions of P50 suppression were 
observed after ayahuasca, no significant effects were found on the startle
response, its habituation rate, or on PPI at any of the prepulse-to-pulse

DMT coincided with the peak of subjective effects. Drug administration increased

beta-carboline alkaloids (harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine). Eighteen
volunteers with prior experience in the use of psychedelics received single oral 
doses of encapsulated freeze-dried ayahuasca (0.6 and 0.85 mg of DMT/kg of body
weight) and placebo. Ayahuasca produced significant subjective effects, peaking
between 1.5 and 2 h, involving perceptual modifications and increases in ratings 
of positive mood and activation. Diastolic blood pressure showed a significant
increase at the high dose (9 mm Hg at 75 min), whereas systolic blood pressure
and heart rate were moderately and nonsignificantly increased. Cmax values for
DMT after the low and high ayahuasca doses were 12.14 ng/ml and 17.44 ng/ml,
respectively. Tmax (median) was observed at 1.5 h after both doses. The Tmax for 
DMT coincided with the peak of subjective effects. Drug administration increased 
urinary normetanephrine excretion, but, contrary to the typical MAO-inhibitor
effect profile, deaminated monoamine metabolite levels were not decreased. This
and the negligible harmine plasma levels found suggest a predominantly peripheral
(gastrointestinal and liver) site of action for harmine. MAO inhibition at this
level would suffice to prevent first-pass metabolism of DMT and allow its access 
to systemic circulation and the central nervous system.",NULL,0.85,"mg/kg body weight","The calculated individual dose for each volunteer was administered by combining 00 gelatin capsules containing different amounts of freeze-dried

Psychopharmacology, 1, 93-8.","RATIONALE: Ayahuasca is a South American psychoactive plant tea which contains
the serotonergic psychedelic N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and monoamine-oxidase
inhibitors that render DMT orally active. Previous investigations with ayahuasca 
have highlighted a psychotropic effect profile characterized by enhanced
introspective attention, with individuals reporting altered somatic perceptions
and intense emotional modifications, frequently accompanied by visual imagery.
Despite recent advances in the study of ayahuasca pharmacology, the neural
correlates of acute ayahuasca intoxication remain largely unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of ayahuasca administration on regional
cerebral blood flow.
METHODS: Fifteen male volunteers with prior experience in the use of psychedelics
received a single oral dose of encapsulated freeze-dried ayahuasca equivalent to 
1.0 mg DMT/kg body weight and a placebo in a randomized double-blind clinical
trial. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured 100-110 min after drug
administration by means of single photon emission tomography (SPECT).
RESULTS: Ayahuasca administration led to significant activation of frontal and
paralimbic brain regions. Increased blood perfusion was observed bilaterally in
the anterior insula, with greater intensity in the right hemisphere, and in the
anterior cingulate/frontomedial cortex of the right hemisphere, areas previously 
implicated in somatic awareness, subjective feeling states, and emotional
arousal. Additional increases were observed in the left amygdala/parahippocampal 
gyrus, a structure also involved in emotional arousal.

systems that are central to interoception and emotional processing and point to a
modulatory role of serotonergic neurotransmission in these processes.",NULL,1,"mg * body weight (kg)","An encapsulated freeze-dried formulation of ayahuasca was obtained as described in prevoius studies.

caapi and Psychotria viridis, has traditionally been used for religious, ritual,

the syncretistic religious use of ayahuasca has expanded to the United States and
Europe. Here we conducted a double-blind randomized crossover clinical trial to
investigate the physiological impact of ayahuasca in terms of autonomic,
neuroendocrine, and immunomodulatory effects. An oral dose of encapsulated
freeze-dried ayahuasca (1.0 mg DMT/kg body weight) was compared versus a placebo 
and versus a positive control (20 mg d-amphetamine) in a group of 10 healthy
volunteers. Ayahuasca led to measurable DMT plasma levels and distinct subjective
and neurophysiological effects that were absent after amphetamine. Both drugs
increased pupillary diameter, with ayahuasca showing milder effects. Prolactin
levels were significantly increased by ayahuasca but not by amphetamine, and
cortisol was increased by both, with ayahuasca leading to the higher peak values.
Ayahuasca and amphetamine induced similar time-dependent modifications in
lymphocyte subpopulations. Percent CD4 and CD3 were decreased, whereas natural
killer cells were increased. Maximum changes occurred around 2 hours, returning
to baseline levels at 24 hours. In conclusion, ayahuasca displayed moderate
sympathomimetic effects, significant neuroendocrine stimulation, and a

mg. Subjective effects involved perceptual modifications analogous to those
observed after ayahuasca and salvia but absent after amphetamine and MDMA.

METHODS: In a 3-day, double-blind, randomized, crossover, counterbalanced study, 
the behavioral, subjective, cognitive, psychophysiological, and endocrine effects
of 0 mg, 8 mg, and 12 mg of inhaled SA were characterized in 10 healthy
individuals who had previously used Salvia.
RESULTS: SA produced psychotomimetic effects and perceptual alterations,
including dissociative and somaesthetic effects, increased plasma cortisol and
prolactin, and reduced resting electroencephalogram spectral power. The SA
administration was associated with a rapid increase of its levels in the blood.
SA did not produce euphoria, cognitive deficits, or changes in vital signs. The
effects were transient and not dose-related. SA administration was very
well-tolerated without acute or delayed adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS: SA produced a wide range of transient effects in healthy subjects.

(2013) Dose-related effects of salvinorin A in humans: dissociative, hallucinogenic, and memory effects.

constituent of the plant Salvia divinorum, which has increased in popularity as a
recreational drug over the past decade. Few human studies have examined
salvinorin A.
OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the dose-related
effects of inhaled salvinorin A in individuals with histories of hallucinogen
use.
METHODS: Eight healthy hallucinogen-using adults inhaled up to 16 doses of
salvinorin A (0.375-21Â Î¼g/kg) in ascending order. Physiological, behavioral, and 
subjective effects were assessed every 2Â min for 60Â min after administration.
Qualitative subjective effects were assessed retrospectively via questionnaires
at the end of sessions. Persisting effects were assessed 1Â month later.
RESULTS: Orderly dose-related effects peaked at 2Â min and then rapidly
dissipated, replicating previous findings. Subjective effects were intense, with 
maximal drug strength ratings or unresponsiveness frequently observed at high
doses. Questionnaires assessing qualitative effects (Hallucinogen Rating Scale,
Pharmacological Class Questionnaire) suggested some overlap with serotonergically
mediated classic hallucinogens. Salvinorin A also produced dose-related
dissociative effects and impairments in recall/recognition memory. At 1-month
follow-up, there was no evidence of persisting adverse effects. Participants
reported that salvinorin A effects were qualitatively different from other drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: Salvinorin A produces a unique profile of subjective and cognitive
effects, including strong dissociative effects and memory impairment, which only 
partially overlap with classic hallucinogen effects. Along with nonhuman studies 
of salvinorin A, these results are important for understanding the neurobiology
of the kappa opioid system and may ultimately have important therapeutic

OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the dose-related
effects of inhaled salvinorin A in individuals with histories of hallucinogen
use.
METHODS: Eight healthy hallucinogen-using adults inhaled up to 16 doses of
salvinorin A (0.375-21Â Î¼g/kg) in ascending order. Physiological, behavioral, and 
subjective effects were assessed every 2Â min for 60Â min after administration.
Qualitative subjective effects were assessed retrospectively via questionnaires
at the end of sessions. Persisting effects were assessed 1Â month later.
RESULTS: Orderly dose-related effects peaked at 2Â min and then rapidly
dissipated, replicating previous findings. Subjective effects were intense, with 
maximal drug strength ratings or unresponsiveness frequently observed at high
doses. Questionnaires assessing qualitative effects (Hallucinogen Rating Scale,
Pharmacological Class Questionnaire) suggested some overlap with serotonergically
mediated classic hallucinogens. Salvinorin A also produced dose-related
dissociative effects and impairments in recall/recognition memory. At 1-month
follow-up, there was no evidence of persisting adverse effects. Participants
reported that salvinorin A effects were qualitatively different from other drugs.

METHODS: We conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study with 2

(2016) Inhibition of alpha oscillations through serotonin-2A receptor activation underlies the visual effects of ayahuasca in humans. European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, 7, 1161-75.","Ayahuasca is an Amazonian psychotropic plant tea typically obtained from two
plants, Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis. It contains the psychedelic 
5-HT2A and sigma-1 agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) plus Î²-carboline
alkaloids with monoamine-oxidase (MAO)-inhibiting properties. Although the
psychoactive effects of ayahuasca have commonly been attributed solely to agonism
at the 5-HT2A receptor, the molecular target of classical psychedelics, this has 
not been tested experimentally. Here we wished to study the contribution of the
5-HT2A receptor to the neurophysiological and psychological effects of ayahuasca 
in humans. We measured drug-induced changes in spontaneous brain oscillations and
subjective effects in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study
involving the oral administration of ayahuasca (0.75mg DMT/kg body weight) and
the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (40mg). Twelve healthy, experienced psychedelic 
users (5 females) participated in four experimental sessions in which they
received the following drug combinations: placebo+placebo, placebo+ayahuasca,
ketanserin+placebo and ketanserin+ayahuasca. Ayahuasca induced EEG power
decreases in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands. Current density in
alpha-band oscillations in parietal and occipital cortex was inversely correlated
with the intensity of visual imagery induced by ayahuasca. Pretreatment with
ketanserin inhibited neurophysiological modifications, reduced the correlation
between alpha and visual effects, and attenuated the intensity of the subjective 
experience. These findings suggest that despite the chemical complexity of
ayahuasca, 5-HT2A activation plays a key role in the neurophysiological and
visual effects of ayahuasca in humans.",NULL,"0.75 + 40","mg/kg + mg","""...at the 0.75 mg/kg DMT dose, participants also ingested 1.51 mg/kg of harmine, 0.16 mg/kg of harmaline and 1.33 mg/kg of THH."" ; ""In each session, participants received an initial treatment that could be placebo (lactose capsule) or 40 mg ketanserin.
