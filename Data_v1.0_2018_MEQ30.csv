hallucinogens are thought to contribute to their potential therapeutic effects.
However, no data have been reported on LSD-induced mystical experiences and their
relationship to alterations of consciousness. Additionally, LSD dose- and

lacking.
METHODS: We conducted two placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over studies
using oral administration of 100 and 200Â Î¼g LSD in 24 and 16 subjects,
respectively. Acute effects of LSD were assessed using the 5 Dimensions of
Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) scale after both doses and the Mystical 
Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) after 200Â Î¼g.
RESULTS: On the MEQ, 200Â Î¼g LSD induced mystical experiences that were comparable
to those in patients who underwent LSD-assisted psychotherapy but were fewer than
those reported for psilocybin in healthy subjects or patients. On the 5D-ASC
scale, LSD produced higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed
