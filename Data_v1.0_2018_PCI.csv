participants completed an Italian translation of the PCI-HAP, with srHD scores
predicted from the PCI-HAP assessment items. The regression analysis replicated
the previous research results. Additionally, stepwise regression analyses were
able to predict the srHD score equally well using only the PCI dimension scores.

to assess hypnotic responsivity, when combined with more traditional
neurophysiological and cognitive-behavioral methodologies, may allow for a more
comprehensive understanding of that enigma called hypnosis.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"""The actual hypnotic induction consisted of a “body scan” (progressive
