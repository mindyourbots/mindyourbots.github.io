psychedelic agent and 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) with
beta-carboline alkaloids showing monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties. Current
human research with psychedelics and entactogens has explored the possibility
that drugs displaying agonist activity at the 5-HT(2A/2C) sites temporally
disrupt inhibitory neural mechanisms thought to intervene in the normal filtering
of information. Suppression of the P50 auditory evoked potential (AEP) and
prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI) are considered operational measures of
sensory (P50 suppression) and sensorimotor (PPI) gating. Contrary to findings in

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of the acute administration of ayahuasca on P50

aetiology of certain types of psychopathology, e.g. in the formation of
delusions. We examine, instead, the top-down influence of pre-existing beliefs
and affective factors in shaping an individual's characterisation of anomalous
sensory experiences. Specifically we investigated the effects of paranormal
beliefs and alexithymia in determining the intensity and quality of an altered
state of consciousness (ASC). Fifty five participants took part in a sweat lodge 
ceremony, a traditional shamanic ritual which was unfamiliar to them.
Participants reported significant alterations in their state of consciousness,
quantified using the 'APZ' questionnaire, a standardized measure of ASC
experience. Participants endorsing paranormal beliefs compatible with shamanic
mythology, and those showing difficulty identifying feelings scored higher on
positive dimensions of ASC experience. Our findings demonstrate that variation in
an individual's characterisation of anomalous experiences is nuanced by
pre-existing beliefs and affective factors.",NULL,NULL,NULL,"A sweat lodge is a small dome shaped structure, consisting of bent wooden poles or sticks covered with thick hides and blankets.

(2015) Salvinorin-A Induces Intense Dissociative Effects, Blocking External Sensory Perception and Modulating Interoception and Sense of Body Ownership in Humans. The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology, 12, .","BACKGROUND: Salvinorin-A is a terpene with agonist properties at the kappa-opioid
receptor, the binding site of endogenous dynorphins. Salvinorin-A is found in
Salvia divinorum, a psychoactive plant traditionally used by the Mazatec people
of Oaxaca, Mexico, for medicinal and spiritual purposes. Previous studies with
the plant and salvinorin-A have reported psychedelic-like changes in perception, 
but also unusual changes in body awareness and detachment from external reality. 
Here we comprehensively studied the profiles of subjective effects of increasing 
doses of salvinorin-A in healthy volunteers, with a special emphasis on
interoception.
METHODS: A placebo and three increasing doses of vaporized salvinorin-A (0.25,
0.50, and 1mg) were administered to eight healthy volunteers with previous
experience in the use of psychedelics. Drug effects were assessed using a battery
of questionnaires that included, among others, the Hallucinogen Rating Scale, the
Altered States of Consciousness, and a new instrument that evaluates different
aspects of body awareness: the Multidimensional Assessment for Interoceptive
Awareness.
RESULTS: Salvinorin-A led to a disconnection from external reality, induced
elaborate visions and auditory phenomena, and modified interoception. The lower
doses increased somatic sensations, but the highest dose led to a sense of a
complete loss of contact with the body.
CONCLUSIONS: Salvinorin-A induced intense psychotropic effects characterized by a
dose-dependent gating of external audio-visual information and an inverted-U
dose-response effect on body awareness. These results suggest a prominent role

(2016) Naltrexone but Not Ketanserin Antagonizes the Subjective, Cardiovascular, and Neuroendocrine Effects of Salvinorin-A in Humans. The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology, 7, .","BACKGROUND: Salvinorin-A is a terpene found in the leaves of the plant Salvia
divinorum. When administered to humans, salvinorin-A induces an intense but
short-lasting modified state of awareness, sharing features with those induced by
the classical serotonin-2A receptor agonist psychedelics. However, unlike
substances such as psilocybin or mescaline, salvinorin-A shows agonist activity
at the kappa-opioid receptor rather than at the serotonin-2A receptor. Here, we
assessed the involvement of kappa-opioid receptor and serotonin-2A agonism in the
subjective, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine effects of salvinorin-A in humans.
METHODS: We conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study with 2
groups of 12 healthy volunteers with experience with psychedelic drugs. There
were 4 experimental sessions. In group 1, participants received the following
treatment combinations: placebo+placebo, placebo+salvinorin-A,
naltrexone+placebo, and naltrexone+salvinorin-A. Naltrexone, a nonspecific opioid
receptor antagonist, was administered at a dose of 50mg orally. In group 2,
participants received the treatment combinations: placebo+placebo,
placebo+salvinorin-A, ketanserin+placebo, and ketanserin+salvinorin-A.
Ketanserin, a selective serotonin-2A antagonist, was administered at a dose of
40mg orally.
RESULTS: Inhalation of 1mg of vaporized salvinorin-A led to maximum plasma
concentrations at 1 and 2 minutes after dosing. When administered alone,

OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the dose-related
effects of inhaled salvinorin A in individuals with histories of hallucinogen
use.
METHODS: Eight healthy hallucinogen-using adults inhaled up to 16 doses of
salvinorin A (0.375-21Â Î¼g/kg) in ascending order. Physiological, behavioral, and 
subjective effects were assessed every 2Â min for 60Â min after administration.
Qualitative subjective effects were assessed retrospectively via questionnaires

RESULTS: Orderly dose-related effects peaked at 2Â min and then rapidly
dissipated, replicating previous findings. Subjective effects were intense, with 
maximal drug strength ratings or unresponsiveness frequently observed at high
doses. Questionnaires assessing qualitative effects (Hallucinogen Rating Scale,

mediated classic hallucinogens. Salvinorin A also produced dose-related
dissociative effects and impairments in recall/recognition memory. At 1-month
follow-up, there was no evidence of persisting adverse effects. Participants
reported that salvinorin A effects were qualitatively different from other drugs.

effects, including strong dissociative effects and memory impairment, which only

METHODS: Participants were 18 adults (17 hallucinogen-naÃ¯ve). Five 8-h sessions
were conducted individually for each participant at 1-month intervals.
Participants were randomized to receive the four active doses in either ascending
or descending order (nine participants each). Placebo was scheduled
quasi-randomly. During sessions, volunteers used eyeshades and were instructed to
direct their attention inward. Volunteers completed questionnaires assessing
effects immediately after and 1 month after each session, and at 14 months
follow-up.
RESULTS: Psilocybin produced acute perceptual and subjective effects including,
at 20 and/or 30 mg/70 kg, extreme anxiety/fear (39% of volunteers) and/or
mystical-type experience (72% of volunteers). One month after sessions at the two
highest doses, volunteers rated the psilocybin experience as having substantial
personal and spiritual significance, and attributed to the experience sustained
positive changes in attitudes, mood, and behavior, with the ascending dose
sequence showing greater positive effects. At 14 months, ratings were
undiminished and were consistent with changes rated by community observers. Both 
the acute and persisting effects of psilocybin were generally a monotonically
increasing function of dose, with the lowest dose showing significant effects.
